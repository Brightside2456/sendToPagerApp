# BUILDING A SEND-TO-PAGER APP #
### PHASE 0
- I start by planning out how the app will function so I even created a simple flowchart to illustrate my thought process
-----------
Flowchart to illustrate thought process

******

- I start to build the UI and structure with the help of HTML and CSS
- I make more research on the css styling and item positioning in the page
- I then move over to JavaScript where I use BMS/mNotify api to allow sending of messages to specified phone numbers
- I used the API with REST API and handled it with the JS's fetch function
 ##### Current State #####

---
1. When you enter the recipients number (in their international format) and enter a custom message in the textarea the message will be sent to the phone
2. There is no form of validation yet
3. Interface still needs better styling
4. There is no confirmatory message or callback to indicate that the message has been sent
